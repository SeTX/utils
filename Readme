Here are some util scrits, some of theme are:

geoip.py - It's a simple GeoIP chaker
 - Works with FreeGeoIP (FreeGeoIP API have a limitation: 10k requests per hour, and supports just IPv6)
 - Suports 1 IP address or a file
 - Can be used like a Module
  
  import geoip
  geo = geoip(ip = '8.8.8.8') 
  # If using file with IPs
  # geo = geoip(file = 'ipList.txt') 
  # 
  # "getGeo" - returns the parsed IPs list
  # "prnt" prints to stdout
  geo.getGeo(prnt = True) 
  
  # Writes parsed IPs to log file
  geo.outWrite(output = 'output.log')
